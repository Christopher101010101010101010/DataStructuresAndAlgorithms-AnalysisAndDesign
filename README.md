# DataStructuresAndAlgorithms-AnalysisAndDesign

In these projects, I worked to address a need for a program that will list and sort all the Computer Science courses for the academic advisors of the Computer Science department at ABCU. I approached this problem by developing pseudocode relating to the implementation of this software package with various data structure implementations, i.e. utilizing a vector data structure, a hash table data structure and a binary search tree data structure. While designing software packages specific to each data structure's implementation requirements I began to understand the value of increased runtime for loading a sorted list over decreased runtime for loading an unsorted vector that will require sorting later. The implementation of my final pseudocode designs for this software package included some complications that required that I deviate from the pseudocode designs, such as inclusion of #ifndef directives and the inline function identifier to correct bugs related to the compiler linker. My understanding of software design and development has advanced through this exercise by reinforcing the need to construct designs that are built on established logic and designs that will achieve the client's goals in the most efficient manner. Through this project I have evolved my programming style to have increased modularity, more comments to explain the activities performed throughout my program, a keener eye for runtime efficiency and I have increased the use of error testing for corrupt files, handles and user inputs. This software package is designed for the academic advisors of the Computer Science department at ABCU to list and sort the Computer Science department's courses' information.
